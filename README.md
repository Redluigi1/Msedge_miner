Microsoft has started providing reward points for searching things using Bing. These points can then be redeemed for gift vouchers on Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
Each search gives 3 points and there is a limit of 30 searches/day. So one can earn 90 points/day.
One can get a Rs100 gift voucher for 1640 points. So each rupee is worth 16.4 points. Hence one can earn Rs5/day by literally doing nothing.
The searching part can be automated using python.
This script used the webbrowser module of python. Upon running it, it searches for random physics terms on bing to get reward points.
The executable of this script was made using pyinstaller.
